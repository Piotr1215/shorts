# Repo for recording shorts on terminal

Each `short` lives in its own directory and has a runnable `demo.sh` script.

The `demo.sh` script contains all the commands run in the short, which is easy
to execute in a local environment.

## Building on open source

The script runner `__demo_magic.sh` is inspired by the excellent idea from
[demo-magic](https://github.com/paxtonhare/demo-magic) repository which allows
for simulating commands typing and output in a terminal.
